# DocumentManager
Web based Document Manager that stores your documents and send it to other users.

I have included a "documentation" file that explains functioning of all the files in this project and it also includes some FAQs for basic working.

I have made this project for 3 types of users, Admin, 2nd Level and 3rd level which gives them different rights and functions.

Please go through the documentation folder and also use Database in Script folder for initializing.
